Entering the lonely house with my wife 
I saw him for the first time 
Peering furtively from behind a bush - 
Blackness that moved, 
A shape amid the shadows, 
A momentary glimpse of gleaming eyes 
Revealed in the ragged moon. 
A closer look (he seemed to turn) might have 
Put him to flight forever - 
I dared not 
For reasons that I failed to understand, 
Though I knew I should act at once. 

I puzzled over it, hiding alone, 
Watching the woman as she neared the gate. 
He came, and I saw him crouching 
Night after night. 
Night after night 
He came, and I saw him crouching, 
Watching the woman as she neared the gate. 

I puzzled over it, hiding alone - 
Though I knew I should act at once, 
For reasons that I failed to understand 
I dared not 
Put him to flight forever. 

A closer look (he seemed to turn) might have 
Revealed in the ragged moon 
A momentary glimpse of gleaming eyes 
A shape amid the shadows, 
Blackness that moved. 

Peering furtively from behind a bush, 
I saw him, for the first time 
Entering the lonely house with my wife.
